Adds the name of Template/Page currently being edited in the [Oxygen](https://oxygenbuilder.com/) editor.

== Description ==

You go to the list of [Oxygen](https://oxygenbuilder.com/) Templates. You click on one. You click on Edit with Oxygen. You are mesmerized by the user friendliness of the Oxygen controls and go building your site visually while appreciating all the while how awesome the built-in Flexbox engine is. You have finished building a few Sections and then it strikes you "What am I editing exactly?". Is it the Main Template or is it the Page Template or something else?

This plugin adds the name of current Template or Page or any other kind of entry that is currently being edited to the left of Structure button in Oxygen's editor interface.

There are no settings for the plugin. Just install, activate and donate (ok, this last part is optional).
